# 👁️ AI Face Classification Game with Teachable Machine & Embedded System

> A real-time face classification game using a custom-trained ML model, embedded systems, and creative gameplay to distinguish "citizens" from "criminals" in a classroom experiment.

## 🚀 Project Summary

This project was built as part of a classroom AI and IoT challenge. We created a game-like simulation that demonstrates facial recognition, machine learning, and embedded system integration in action.

Each group (6 total) had 5 members. Out of those:
- 🧍‍♂️ 2 were designated as "citizens"
- 🕵️‍♂️ 3 were secretly labeled as "criminals"

We trained a custom machine learning model using **Teachable Machine by Google**, feeding in facial data for each group member. During the game:
- One member was chosen and sat in front of my system.
- Our model ran inference on their face using webcam input.
- The result triggered:
  - 🔵 Blue LED: Citizen
  - 🔴 Red LED: Criminal

This decision was powered by an **embedded system** connected to my PC that responded in real-time to the classification results.
